Enable automatically approving requests for developer and application registration.
When automatic approval is enabled, a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin does not
need to manually manage the requests for developer and application registration approvals.
Auto Approve is disabled by default. You can enable and disable approvals at any time.

If there are any pending requests when Auto Approve is enabled, those requests must be manually approved.

Auto Approve for application registration can be enabled in two ways:

* On a per Service basis when enabling application registration.
* On a portal-wide basis using the Portal Settings.

If Auto Approve is enabled portal-wide, it overrides the per Service setting.
