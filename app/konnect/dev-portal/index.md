The Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_product_name}} contains an API Catalog,
which allows you to document all of your Services and Versions.

* Markdown documentation: a description of your Service. Applies to the whole
Service package.
* Version spec: An OAS/Swagger document in YAML or JSON format. Applies to a
specific Service Version.

The purpose of the Portal is to allow registration and consumption of services
running through Kong to other teams, developers, partners, and so on.

You can access the Developer Portal for any published Service through the URL
found on the **Dev Portal** page. The format looks something like this:

```
<org-name>.portal.khcp.konghq.com
```
