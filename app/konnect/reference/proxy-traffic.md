## Proxy Traffic for your Kong Proxy Nodes

The Proxy URL is used to access a Service.  
1. Copy the Proxy URL. You can find the Proxy URL at the top of any Service Version Overview page.
2. Place the URL into a browser and append with the path name. For example, in this guide we use **http://mockbin.org** to create a Service with a path **/mock**. When you put the URL into a browser, add **/mock** at the end of the Proxy URL. The upstream is mockbin, or front-end access to the service.
