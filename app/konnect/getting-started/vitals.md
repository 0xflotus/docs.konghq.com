## Overview
Use Kong Vitals (Vitals) to monitor the health and performance of
{{site.konnect_product_name}} (Konnect). Vitals uses visual API analytics to
see exactly how your APIs and Gateway are performing. Quickly access key
statistics, monitor vital signs, and pinpoint anomalies in real time.

There are a few ways you can view Vitals:
* Services view
* Version view
* Route view

## View Vitals for a Service

2. In the Traffic section, the Vitals graph displays events for all the
versions of your Service. Hover over an area of of the graph to view details,
including version information and time of the event.

    By default, the graphs display data for the past 30 minutes. For the
