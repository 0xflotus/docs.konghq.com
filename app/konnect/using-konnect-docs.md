The {{site.konnect_product_name}} ({{site.konnect_short_name}}) docs provide
information about how to manage and deploy {{site.konnect_short_name}} using
the SaaS-hosted control plane or in a self-hosted environment.

## Konnect SaaS-hosted control plane
{{site.konnect_short_name}} lets you manage multiple runtimes from a
single, cloud-based control plane, giving you an overview of all deployed
services. You can deploy the runtimes in different environments, data
centers, geographies, or zones without needing a local clustered database for
each runtime group.

{{site.konnect_short_name}} deployment, see the
