Publish Services to the Dev Portal to expose them to your application
developers.

Through the ServiceHub, you can publish any Service in your catalog to the Dev
Portal using its default URL, which looks something like this:

```
 https://<org-name>.portal.konnect.konghq.com/
 ```

Setting up custom Dev Portal URLs is not currently supported through
{{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS. If needed,
contact [Kong Support](https://support.konghq.com/), and we will manually set up
a custom Dev Portal URL for your {{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS account.

## Publish a Service

1. From the left navigation menu, open the **Services** page and select a
Service.

2. Click on the **Actions** dropdown and select **Publish to Portal**.

    This publishes all of the Service's version specs to the Dev Portal.

3. From the left navigation menu again, go to **Dev Portal**.

4. Click the **Portal URL** to access your Dev Portal, or click the gear icon for
any published Service and select **View in portal**.

## Unpublish a Service

1. In the left navigation menu, open the **Services** page and select a Service.

2. Click on the **Actions** dropdown and select **Unpublish from Portal**.
