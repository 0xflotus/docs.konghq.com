header_title: Is Kong PCI DSS Compliant?
---

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of industry-mandated requirements that apply to any business that handles, processes, or stores credit cards, regardless of the business's size or location.

You will still need to complete an annual [Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php) in order to be PCI compliant. There are several different types of SAQs, and a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) can help you choose the right one for your business and achieve compliance.
