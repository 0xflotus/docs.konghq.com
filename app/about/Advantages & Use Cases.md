**Advantages**

Kong has several advantages compared to other API management platforms and tools. Community favorites include:

- Open-Source
- Based on NGINX (trustable)
- Customizable
- Data Ownership is 100% yours
- Full Control - No black box
- Easy to install, use and scale
- Plugins and Integrations

**Use Cases**

Because Kong is open-source you'll have full control. It's perfectly suited for managing *internal* Microservice traffic as well as *partners* or *public* entities. 
 
 ***Internal***
 
Internal API traffic that connects microservices built inside your organization can originate from teams in different geographic regions, but belong to the same entity. Internal microservices and APIs can be deployed either on bare metal or a cloud provider.

 ***Partners***
 
Parters usage is when your software has to communicate with a mission critical third party microservice to offer its key features (and vice-versa). For example a credit card company relies on at least one bank to offer its service. In the past most of those connections would happen via an ESB, nowadays all you need is an API Gateway.

 ***Public***
 
Public is when you offer your API with a self-serve onboarding process. Any developer can get a key and access/consume your services. An example of this model is Facebook's Graph API. Common features are authentication, rate limiting, and billing tiers if it's a paid API.
