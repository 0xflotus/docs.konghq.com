## How to Invite a New Admin from the Organization Page

Inviting a new Admin through the “Organization” page is similar to inviting an [Admin within a Workspace](#how-to-invite-a-new-admin-in-a-workspace). However, from the “Organization” page, Roles can be assigned to a new Admin for multiple Workspaces at once. The Super Admin can also view global roles across Workspaces from this page.

1. On the “Organization” page, to invite a new Admin, click the “Invite User” button.

2. Fill out the username and email address. When a new Admin receives an invitation, they will only be able to log in with that email address. Assign the appropriate Role and click “Invite User” to send the invitation.

    ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Super Admins can invite users to multiple Workspaces, and assign them any Role available within Workspaces, including Roles that exist by default (e.g. super-admin, read-only) and Roles with customized permissions. 

    ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The Super Admin can see all available roles across Workspaces on the “Roles” tab of the “Organization” page.

3. On the “Organization” page, the new invitee will appear on the list with the “Invited” status. Once they accept the invitation, the user will be listed in the main “Users” list.

4. The newly invited Admin will have the ability to set a password. If the Admin ever forgets the password, it is possible for them to reset it through a recovery email.
