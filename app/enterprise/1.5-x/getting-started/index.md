### Introduction

Thank you for installing Kong Enterprise! The following series of Getting Started
guides is designed to help you familiarize yourself with Kong Enterprise's features
and capabilities, with practical steps to start Kong Enterprise securely, access
Kong Manager as a **Super Admin**, and create new entities such as **Services**.

Each guide also contains links to more in-depth material. Note that Kong
 Enterprise 0.35 includes Kong 1.0 at its core, so CLI commands and most Admin
 API endpoints are documented in standard [Kong documentation](/1.0.x/).

 If you have any issues or further questions, please
[contact Support](https://support.konghq.com/support/s/) and they will be happy
 to help.
