### How it works

When enabled, this plugin will capture API requests and responses and log to
[Moesif API Insights](https://www.moesif.com) for easy inspecting and real-time
debugging of your API traffic.

Moesif natively supports REST, GraphQL, Ethereum Web3, SOAP, JSON-RPC, and more.

[Package on Luarocks](http://luarocks.org/modules/moesif/kong-plugin-moesif)

### How to install

The .rock file is a self contained package that can be installed locally or from a remote server.

If the luarocks utility is installed in your system (this is likely the case if you used one of the official installation packages), you can install the 'rock' in your LuaRocks tree (a directory in which LuaRocks installs Lua modules).

It can be installed from luarocks repository by doing:

```shell
luarocks install kong-plugin-moesif
```

### Kong process errors

This logging plugin will only log HTTP request and response data. If you are looking for the Kong process error file (which is the nginx error file), then you can find it at the following path: FIXME
