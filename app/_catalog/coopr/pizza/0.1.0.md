  When your API returns a 500 error, something has clearly gone wrong.
  You don't want wrongness to increase in the world, so you like to right wrongs right away, right?
  But righting wrongs requires, typically, 2 pizzas - for your 2-pizza Agile software teams.
  Thus, with the assistance of this plugin, you will automatically receive 2 pizzas each
  time your API returns a 500 error.

  Studies* have shown that applying 2 pizzas to 500 errors tends to clear them right up!

  *Unpublished studies, not peer reviewed, but hey, pizza helps!

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

### Heading 1 here

Important important Pizza PIZZA!

### Known Issues

#### Too Many Pizzas

If your API returns a lot of 500 errors, your Agile software development team may
receive more pizzas than they can reasonably consume.

#### Too Few Pizzas

If your API is exceptionally reliable, your Agile software development team may starve.

### Step By Step Guide

#### The Steps
1. Add Pizza plugin to an API, Route, or Service
1. Wait for a 500 error to occur
1. Watch the pizza-fueled softwareing that ensues
1. Pass out napkins and move that card to done!
