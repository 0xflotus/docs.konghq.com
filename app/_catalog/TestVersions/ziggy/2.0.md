### This is the 2.0 version

In this example, the versions are numbers, and only some of the versions have dates.

The versions are ordered by the order of their appearance in the `app/_data/extensions/TestVersions.yml` file - that file includes:

```
ziggy:
  versions:
    - release: 4.0
      date: 2018-08-25
    - release: 3.0
      date: 2018-08-03
    - release: 2.0
    - release: 1.0
```

Which results in the version order you see in this page's sidebar and version picker dropdown.
