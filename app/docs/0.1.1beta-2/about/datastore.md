# What datastore does it use?

Currently Kong runs on Apache Cassandra, while technically Kong can easily be expanded to support any datastore. While that is a possibility, for the time being we are only providing support for Apache Cassandra, due to it being the best option for starting out small, and scaling big.

In the future we may introduce support for other SQL datastores like MySQL or Postgres, or for NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
